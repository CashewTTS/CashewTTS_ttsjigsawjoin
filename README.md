# Jigsaw Join for Tabletop Simulator

Previous versions of this mod lacked up-to-date public git repos, or the asset hosting wasn't maintained. This repo aims to consolidate work by various developers, including AnthonySunkist (brainsick), BandedOtter (Canonelis), and myself. It will provide everything needed to build the mod with minimal effort, use GitHub to host the assets, attempt to provide scripts for recreating the existing piece sets from scratch if one wants to tweak them, and support future collaboration by including Python functions that make it easy to generate additional piece sets of more-creative shapes/styles.

Pull requests are welcome!
